                           LEVEL CREATION GUIDE 
================================================================================

1. FILE NAMING & LOCATION
   - Files must be named `adv_world_XX.screen` (e.g., `adv_world_01.screen`).
   - Place files in the game's working directory (next to the .exe).
   - The game loads them in lexicographical order.

2. FILE STRUCTURE
   The file is divided into sections marked by brackets (e.g., `[MAP]`). 
   Order matters: The Loader scans the map from Top-Left to Bottom-Right. 
   Properties in the sections below the map are assigned to objects in that exact order.

3. SECTION: [MAP] ... [/MAP]
   - Draw the level layout here (80x25 characters max).
   - MANDATORY: Include 'L' for the HUD/Legend location.
   - TILES:
     W = Wall           |  * = Obstacle (Multi-tile supported)
     $ = Player 1       |  & = Player 2
     K = Key            |  ! = Torch
     @ = Bomb           |  P = Potion
     ? = Riddle         |  # = Spring (Use ^ v < > for direction)
     / or \ = Switch    |  1-9 = Doors (Digit is the ID)

4. OBJECT CONFIGURATION SECTIONS
