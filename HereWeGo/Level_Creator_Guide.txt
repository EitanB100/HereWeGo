                              LEVEL CREATOR GUIDE
================================================================================

1. FILE NAMING & LOCATION
   - Files must follow the naming convention: adv_world_XX.screen (e.g., adv_world_01.screen).
   - Files are loaded in lexicographical order.
   - Place them in the game's working directory.

2. FILE SECTIONS
   The level file is divided into blocks. The most critical is [MAP]. The blocks
   following the map provide specific data for objects found during the map scan.

3. OBJECTS & MAP CHARACTERS
   Objects are identified by characters on the grid. Most are scanned from 
   Top-Left to Bottom-Right.

   - Players ($ &): The starting positions for Player 1 ($) and Player 2 (&).
   - Walls (W): Solid, unpassable, and immovable boundaries.
   - Obstacles (*): Blocks that can be pushed if the player has enough force.
     Adjacent '*' characters are treated as a single multi-tile obstacle.
   - Springs (^, v, <, >): Launchers that push players in the direction of the 
     arrow. Multiple adjacent spring chars of the same type form one 
     long spring.
   - Keys (K): Collectible items used to open doors.
   - Switches (/ \): Interactive floor tiles that toggle between ON (/) and OFF (\).
   - Doors (1-9): Passable gates. Digits represent the Door ID.
   - Torches (!): Items that provide illumination in dark areas.
   - Bombs (@): Collectible explosives with a 5-tick timer.
   - Potions (P): Collectible health-restoring items.
   - Riddles (?): Obstacles that require a correct answer to pass.
   - Legend (L): Defines the top-left coordinate where the HUD (Health, Timer, 
     Score) will be printed.
   - Exit (E): Level end point. from there the next level is being loaded
    (if both players arrived) or the game ends (if its the last level)

4. DATA BLOCK FORMATS
   Blocks after [/MAP] configure the objects found on the grid:

   [DOORS]
